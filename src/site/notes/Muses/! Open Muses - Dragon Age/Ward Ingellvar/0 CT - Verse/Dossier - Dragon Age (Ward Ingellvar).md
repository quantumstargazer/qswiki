# Quick Guide To Interacting
## Things *You* Should Know
- ***Ward is written as autistic*** — this will become most noticable when they go from being highly reserved and quiet to bouncy and ecstatic under certain circumstances, most notably when they talk about their special interests.
- 
## Things Your Muse *Could* Know
- **Ghost of the Necropolis** - Ward gained the moniker of "*Ghost*" as a result of their tendency to avoid the living as a child, often preferring the company of wisps, spirits, and benevolent undead — their tutors, including Myrna, are the few exceptions.
- **Chocolate Fiend** - Ward *loves* chocolate, and will go to great lengths to obtain it if someone tries to keep it from them.
## Things Your Muse Should *Not* Know
- **Spirit of Learning** - Ward started out as a curious little wisp with a desperate desire to learn who was nurtured into a Spirit of Learning by the teachings of a greater Spirit of Wisdom[^1].  Most others would be unaware of this, *especially* before Ward themself remembers anything about their life in The Fade, unless they are significantly powerful enough to tell (Vorgoth knows, because they were there shortly after Ward first took physical form and it was very clear in those moments what Ward truly was).
