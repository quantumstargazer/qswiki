# Canon Typical
> [!summary]+ Dragon Age
> - *Defaults to Veilguard era timelines. (9:45 - 9:54 Dragon)*
> 
> **Ashina de Riva** is a Master Assassin of House de Riva of the Antivan Crows, likely serving as the Fifth Talon's Second, and is the Warden-Commander of Antiva. She specialises in contacts for entire noble households, methodically wiping out an entire family line and their house in a single evening.
> 
> While it is known among the Crows that she is also a Grey Warden, few outside of a handful of Talons and other high ranking Crows know that she is, in fact, the notorious Hero of Ferelden, widely known as "*Warden Tathas*", who joined the Antivan Crows in 9:33 Dragon to escape from Weisshaupt and the First Warden's orders that she be brought in for questioning regarding her surviving killing an archdemon.

# Canon Divergent AUs
> [!summary]+ Rook 
> - *Defaults to Veilguard timeline. (9:50 - 9:54 Dragon)*
> 
> One thing Ashina can never turn her back on is slavery, especially after the incident in the Denerim Alienage during the Fifth Blight, so there was simply no way she was going to ignore the Antaam slavers, *especially* when she spotted one of her own friends in their cages — not even to report in to her Talon for instruction.
> 
> Her actions disrupt the Talons' plans — plans she hadn't been at all aware of — and as a result, she is sent on an extended contract to hunt the Dread Wolf when Varric Tethras shows up requesting her help in stopping Solas from destroying the world.

> [!summary]+ Inquisitor
> - *Starts in Inquisition timeline. (9:40 - 9:44 Dragon)*
> 
> Ashina hadn't wanted anything to do with the Divine's Conclave, nor the Mage-Templar conflict, but she has no choice when the First Talon orders her to go spy on the meetings. When she finds signs of a Grey Warden presence at the Conclave, she knows *something* isn't right, and heads to where she suspects the records might be kept to check the list of expected attendees, only to stumble across the Warden mages in the middle of a blood magic ritual, and the Divine their intended sacrifice.
