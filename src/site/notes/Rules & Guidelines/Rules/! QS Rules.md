> [!attention]- Read Rules Before Following
> I *actively block* people who obviously did not read my rules before following me first — typically for their being under the age of 21, and/or their blog containing banned content such as fandoms, faceclaims, &/or tropes & themes.

# Don't Be A Dick
This *should* got without saying, *and yet...*

# 21+ & Mutuals Only
If you don't have an age range that actively states you are *at least 21+* listed on your blog and/or in your rules, I *will not* follow you, nor will I write roleplay with you. I am in my early 40s, and just simply do not wish to write with anyone younger than US drinking age at this point.

# Curate Your Own Dash
## Don't Like? Don't Follow.
If you don't like me, my muses, my verses, my blog, etc., then *just don't follow me* — in fact, if you feel that strongly about any of these things, you should probably *hard block* me and *keep me blocked* [^1] instead, so as to keep my content off your dash.
## Hard Block Only - No Soft Block
If you feel the need to block me at all for any reason, *hard block* me, even if you typically only soft block. I am unable to reliably remember if someone has simply soft blocked me instead, and may refollow if I find your blog again in the future, being completely unable to remember that I had followed you in the past. [^1]

# Additional Guidelines May Apply
Because everyone is different in how they want to interact, not all of the guidelines are applicable to every person who follows me. It's this reason that these are broken down into the way that they are.

# Footnotes

[^1]: I have severe memory issues due to various comorbid medical conditions, including a traumatic brain injury, so I sincerely *cannot* be relied on to remember if you merely unfollowed &/or soft blocked me. It is for the best that I simply *remain blocked*, and that if you move to a new blog in the future, *especially* if you change your username, that you continue to block me from the new blog(s) as well.

[^2]: If pregnancy becomes a part of any interaction, the active labor and childbirth will be time skipped to when the baby has arrived and has been cleaned up — *no exceptions*.

[^3]: I don't care *how anti-JK Rowling* you are — I will *not* follow or interact with you if you have any Harry Potter muses or verses on your blog.

[^4]: If they have *genuine face acting roles*, such as would be the case with someone like David Bowie in Labyrinth (1986), then they're fine. Cameos *do not count*, especially in the case of Youtubers.
