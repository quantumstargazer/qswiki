> [!FAQ] What Are Open Muses?
> Open Muses are the muses that, unless you tell me you're *not* interested in them by filling out the (Dis)Interest Tracker form, then they are who I am more likely to throw your way at random, from any of their canon-based verses and/or fandom matched AUs.

# Dragon Age
## Ashina de Riva née Tabris
*City Elf — ~~Grey Wardens~~ (defected) Antivan Crows — Master Assassin*
> [!hint]- Hero of Ferelden turned Antivan Crow
> Ashina was conscripted against her will into the Grey Wardens at the start of the Fifth Blight in 9:30 Dragon, going by the name of "*Tathas Arainai*". By 9:31 Dragon, she was notoreous among the Wardens by having survived killing the archdemon and ending the Blight, only then to encounter the darkspawn magister known only as the Architect several months later, and then letting it live. The First Warden issued orders for her to be brought in — *alive* — to Weisshaupt for questioning. No warden had survived the attempt until she was said to have been killed by the Antivan Crows in 9:33 Dragon.
