# Quick Summary
## Quote
"No, no. Let's not, and say we did."
## Summary 
**Ashina de Riva** is a Master Assassin of House de Riva of the Antivan Crows, likely serving as the Fifth Talon's Second, and is the Warden-Commander of Antiva. She specialises in contacts for entire noble households, methodically wiping out an entire family line and their house in a single evening.

While it is known among the Crows that she is also a Grey Warden, few outside of a handful of Talons and other high ranking Crows know that she is, in fact, the notorious Hero of Ferelden, widely known as "*Warden Tathas*", who joined the Antivan Crows in 9:33 Dragon to escape from Weisshaupt and the First Warden's orders that she be brought in for questioning regarding her surviving killing an archdemon.

# Background
## Birth & Early Childhood 
Ashina Tabris was born on the 30th of Harvestmere, 9:06 Dragon, to Cyrion Tabris and Adaia Tabris née Arainai, in the Alienage in Denerim, Ferelden.
## Childhood & Adolescence 
At the age of 17, Ashina witnessed the death of her mother at the hands of a group of humans while they were returning to the Alienage from the market. She had hid in the shadows, just as her mother had taught her, while Adaia was murdered, terrified of what they might do to *her*, should they find her.
## Adulthood 
For years since Adaia's death, Ashina has been allowed the time to grieve her mother's loss without the added pressure from her father to marry so she might finally be recognized as an adult by Alienage standards. 
By 9:30 Dragon, the *hahren* has finally convinced Cyrion that she's been allowed to delay long enough, and a marriage is arranged for her to Nelaros of Highever, a skilled blacksmith that Cyrion hopes will be a good match for his stubborn daughter.
## Future Outlook 


# Quotes & Catchphrases
- "I killed them like dogs, Shianni. Not just them. All the humans who hurt you." — *said to her cousin, Shianni, after freeing her and the other women stolen from the Alienage - 9:30 Dragon.*
- "Believe in whatever you like; absent creators or whimsical gods. Follow prophets or ashkaati, or omens in the earth and sky. You will find wisdom only if you seek it." — *quoting Sten's wisdom from their time traveling together during the Fifth Blight.*

# Trivia
- Ashina's first kills were the ones she made freeing herself after being kidnapped, and she killed *each and every guard and human noble* that she came across, leaving a river of blood trailing behind her as she fought to try to reach Shianni in time.

# Quick Guide To Interacting
## Things *You* Should Know
- **Ashina Tabris Is Dead** - Ashina completely stops going by her *actual* name of "***Ashina Tabris***" when she is no longer living within the Denerim Alienage — whether this is by being conscripted by the Grey Wardens, taken by the Antivan Crows, or whatever other fate she faces. Very few people who meet her after this ever learn her *true* family name, and many may never even learn her given name, if she introduces herself as "***Tathas Arainai***" instead.
