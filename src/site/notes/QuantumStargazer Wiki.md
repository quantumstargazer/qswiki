# QuantumStargazer
[QuantumStargazer](https://quantumstargazer.tumblr.com/) is an *Independent*, *Selective*, *21+ & Mutuals Only* Multifandom Multimuse blog featuring canon, canon-based, and original characters from Baldur's Gate, Dragon Age, Mass Effect, & more.
## RP Info
- **Multi-Verse** — All [[Muse Info/! Open Muses - Roster\|Open Muses]] have Canon-Based Verses, Fandom Specific AUs, Trapped In Another World AUs, &/or Other Verses & AUs.
- **Multi-Ship** — Ships are not Highlanders - there can be more than one. And there will be. *There will be.*
- **Loose Plotting Only** — Not a heavy or strict planner; if you *are*, then I'm probably not who you want to try to plot with.
- **In Character Posts Immediately** — IC posts are never queued - only prompts, memes, aesthetics, etc. are queued.

# Footnotes
[^1]: Essentially a permanent starter call with benefits — this is the only permanent starter call you will find on my blog. It's mostly a major reliever of social anxiety for me, for having explicit permission to interact.

[^2]: Covers everything from the list of canon-typical content warnings for anyone unfamiliar with the fandoms I write, to why I might not follow someone back if they follow me first. Just those things that don't quite fit in the Rules & Guidelines, but are useful to know anyway without having to dig through posts for answered memes and hope someone's actually asked it.
