# Footnotes
[^1]: Covers everything from the list of canon-typical content warnings for anyone unfamiliar with the fandoms I write, to why I might not follow someone back if they follow me first. Just those things that don't quite fit in the Rules & Guidelines, but are useful to know anyway without having to dig through posts for answered memes and hope someone's actually asked it.
